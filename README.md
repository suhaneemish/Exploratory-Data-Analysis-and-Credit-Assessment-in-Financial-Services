# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Credit-Assessment-in-Financial-Services
This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the development of a predictive machine learning model to assess the risk of loan defaults based on financial data.
It incorporates extensive data analysis and employs machine learning algorithms to predict default probabilities, with a Flask-based web application for real-time predictions.

# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze financial data to identify significant patterns and relationships that predict loan default risks. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and the deployment of the model via a Flask web application.

# Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for creating visualizations.
scikit-learn: Employed for building and tuning machine learning models.
Flask: Used to deploy the machine learning model as a web application.
SQL: For data querying and extraction from databases.
Features
Data Analysis: Extensive analysis of the data to uncover insights and prepare the data for modeling.
Predictive Modeling: Development of robust models to forecast loan defaults.
Web Application: A Flask app that allows users to make real-time predictions using the trained model.
